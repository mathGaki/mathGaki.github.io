A brief overview\nCapture\nClarify\nOrganize\nEngage\nReview\n\n\nGetting Things Done, or GTD for short, is a popular task management system created by productivity consultant David Allen. The methodology is based on a simple truth: The more information bouncing around inside your head, the harder it is to decide what needs attention. As a result, you spend more time thinking about your tasks than actually doing them. When information piles up in your head, it leads to stress, overwhelm, and uncertainty.\nAllen observed that our brains are much better at processing information than storing it (“your head’s a crappy office”). His GTD method lays out how to dump all your mental clutter into an external system and then organize it so you can focus on the right things at the right times. When your GTD workflow is set up right, you’ll be able to confidently answer “what should I be working on?” at any given moment without worrying that you might forget something important you need to do later.\nTry GTD if you…\n\nFeel overwhelmed by the amount of things you need to keep track of\nWorry about forgetting small details\nWear lots of hats in your job and life\nStarts lots of projects but have trouble finishing them\nHave never GTD’d before (everyone should GTD at least once in their lives)\n\nThis guide will introduce you to GTD principles and workflows and what we think is the most intuitive way to implement them. We’ll be focusing on how to GTD with Todoist, but the same principles apply no matter what app you use. The key to GTD isn’t the specific tools you choose but rather the habits you employ on a daily basis to think about and prioritize your work.\nRecommended reading\nIf you’re completely new to GTD, we highly recommend reading Allen’s bestselling book, Getting Things Done, and, if you’re a Todoist user, buying the official GTD Todoist Setup Guide for a more complete overview of setting up your GTD system with Todoist.\nWhat is GTD? A brief overview\n\nThe GTD method is made up of five simple practices to systematize the clutter in your brain and get things done:\n\nCapture Everything: Capture anything that crosses your mind. Nothing is too big or small! These items go directly into your inboxes.\nClarify: Process what you’ve captured into clear and concrete action steps. Decide if an item is a project, next action, or reference.\nOrganize: Put everything into the right place. Add dates to your calendar, delegate projects to other people, file away reference material, and sort your tasks.\nReview: Frequently look over, update, and revise your lists.\nEngage: Get to work on the important stuff.\n\nWhile GTD requires an upfront investment in time and energy to set up, it pays off with consistent use. You’ll no longer worry about forgetting a deadline or missing an important task. Instead, you’ll be able to respond to incoming information calmly and prioritize your time confidently.\n\nSome very specific but seemingly mundane behaviors, when applied, produce the capacity to exist in a kind of sophisticated spontaneity, which, in my experience, is a key element to a successful life.\n— David Allen\n\nThough the basis of GTD are these five simple steps, they’re not always easy to execute. GTD doesn’t require a specific tool, app, or product. Allen doesn’t even make a case for digital over analog systems. Rather, the key to any lasting productivity system is to keep it as simple as possible and to use it as often as possible. Your tool should be versatile enough to handle your most complex projects yet simple enough to maintain when you’re low on energy.\nThe rest of this article will cover the specifics of each of the five GTD practices above and walk you through how to implement them with Todoist. But, again, the same principles should apply no matter what tool you use.\nCapture\nFor GTD to work, you must stop storing information in your brain. Anything that crosses your mind — to-dos, events, ideas, book recommendations, etc. — must be captured and stored immediately in an inbox. In GTD, an inbox, be it physical or digital, is a visual representation of all the inputs you need to somehow deal with on a daily basis.\nYour inbox is only used to collect the chaos of your thoughts in order to get them off your mind. This is not the place or time to worry about organization.\nIn Todoist, your inbox will be the default place to hold all your inputs until you can organize them. To add a new task to your Inbox in the web or desktop apps, click the plus sign in the right corner or simply press “q.” The task will be added to the Inbox by default unless you otherwise specify a project.\nDo an initial mind sweep\nIf you’re just starting out with GTD, do a full mind sweep of all the “open loops” you can think of — anything you might need to take action on in the future. Add them as tasks to your Todoist Inbox now. Consult the GTD trigger list to help jog your memory for commitments you may have forgotten.\nCapture new tasks right away\nOne of the core tenets of GTD is to get tasks out of your head and into your external system the moment they come to you. Todoist syncs across platforms — computer, phone, web browser, email client, smartwatch, or smart home assistant — so you can enter tasks anytime, from anywhere.\nWhenever a new task comes to mind, make it a habit to immediately add it to your Inbox and worry about organizing it later. To capture tasks as quickly as possible wherever you are, we recommend installing Todoist or your app of choice:\n\nAs an app on your computer\nAs an app on your phone\nAs an extension for the web browser you use (for adding websites as tasks)\nAs a plugin for the email client you use (for adding emails as tasks)\n\nBrowse and download the Todoist apps\nConsolidate your inboxes\nYou can use Todoist to consolidate your other inboxes — from emails you need to follow up on, to messages you need to take action on, to articles to read, to grocery lists, to reference materials you save for later. The fewer inboxes you have to check for open loops, the easier your system will be to maintain.\nSend items to Todoist from your email or team messaging tool:\n\nUse Todoist’s plugins for Gmail and Outlook to quickly add emails as tasks\nForward emails directly to your Todoist inbox using your project forwarding address.\nTurn messages into tasks from your team messaging tools like Twist or Slack.\n\n\nCapture reading &amp; reference material:\n\nTake photos of business cards or event reminders and attach them to the relevant task’s comments.\nAttach files from Dropbox, Google Drive, or your computer to any task to read or work on later.\nConnect a reading app like Pocket with Todoist via our IFTTT integration and have a Todoist task automatically created every time you add an article to Pocket.\nDownload Todoist for Chrome, Safari, or Firefox to save any url to access later.\nUse the Todoist share extensions on Android or iOS to share pages from mobile apps as tasks.\n\n\nAttach reference materials – photos, documents, links, notes, or even audio files – to the relevant tasks.\nDive deeper\nClarify\nNow that your inbox is full, the next step is to transform the chaotic clutter of everything you’ve captured into concrete action steps. Go through each item in your inbox, and do one of the following (there are more specifics on how to do each step in the next section):\n\nIf the item will take less than 2 minutes, complete it right away.\nIf it can be delegated, assign the task to someone else.\nIf it’s a non-actionable reference item (e.g., a file, document, article, contact information, etc.) that you’ll need to come back to later, file it away in a separate reference project or attach it to the comments of the relevant task or project.\nIf the item needs to be done at a specific date and/or time, give the task a due date.\nIf the task is no longer needed or actionable, delete it.\nIf a task requires more than one step, create a project to house all of the items associated with it and identify the next action you can take to move the project forward.\n\n\nMake your tasks as specific and actionable as possible. Add as much information as you can to save you time puzzling over it later. For example, “Call Mom” may actually need to be entered as “Call Mom to discuss birthday dinner.” Or, “Taxes” could be “Call Mary to discuss tax documents” with Mary’s phone number and a list of the specific documents attached in the task’s comments (more on task comments later).\n\nMake your tasks as specific and actionable as possible.\nOrganize\nOnce you’ve clarified an item in your inbox, it’s time to sort it into the appropriate place. In reality, clarifying and organizing your tasks will happen in tandem as you clean out your inbox, but it’s helpful to think about them as separate actions.\nThere are many different ways to organize your tasks with the GTD methodology, but we recommend using a combination of projects and labels.\nOne-off tasks\nThese are tasks that take longer than 2 minutes but only require one step. For example, “reply to Josh’s email about project pricing” or “renew car tabs.” You don’t want them cluttering up your inbox, but they also don’t belong in any other project.\n\nCreate a new Todoist project for one-off tasks\n\nCreate a new project called One-Off Tasks.\nDrag and drop your one-step tasks from the inbox to this project by clicking on the grey “handle” to the left of the task name and dragging it to the project name in the left-hand menu.\nYou can also designate a different project by typing ”#” into the task field to pull up a list of all your projects. Select your project from the list or type the project name to narrow down the results.\n\n\nUse the # shortcut to select a project\nProjects\nYou’ll find that many of the tasks you wrote down are actually projects. In the GTD philosophy, projects are any item that requires more than one step to complete. For example, “paint the bedroom” is a project because it includes other tasks like getting paint samples, picking a color, buying supplies, prepping walls, etc. Here’s how to handle projects in Todoist:\n\nCreate a new project for each multi-step project you identified as you were clarifying your tasks.\nDrag and drop the associated tasks from your Inbox to the appropriate project. Or click on a task and type ”#” into the task field to pull up a list of your projects to choose from.\nAs you think of other steps, add them as new tasks inside the projects.\n\n\nCreate a project for any item that takes 2 or more steps to complete\nAreas of focus\nIt may be helpful to group your projects based on your ”Areas of Focus” — the GTD term for the various areas of responsibility you have in your life. These areas are a tool to draw attention to your broader life goals while deciding what to work on next. If a task does not fit within the scope of any of your areas of focus, it may be time to reassess if it’s something you want to spend your time on. Or you may just want to separate your projects between “Work” and “Personal.”\nYou can easily accomplish this in Todoist using sub-projects. Here’s how:\n\nCreate a project for each area of focus. This project won’t have any tasks in it; it’s just for visual organization.\nClick on the grey handle to the left of the project name and drag and indent your actual projects underneath the high-level “Folders” you just created to turn them into sub-projects.\n(Optional) To create even more visual separation between your areas of focus, assign a different project color for each area.\n\n\nNestle sub-projects under each Area of Focus\nNow, you can keep your project list clean by collapsing your sub-projects underneath the parent project. For example, while you’re at work, you can keep your work projects in view while your personal projects are hidden and vice versa.\nTo keep things simple, finish setting up your GTD system first to get a sense of your workflow. If needed, come back and organize your projects into broader categories later.\nNext actions\nThese are tasks with a clear, concrete action you’ll do at the next opportunity (e.g., “Email James the budget for the office party”). Next actions are separate from future actions — steps you’ll take eventually but do not need your focus right now.\nIdentify the next action for each project by tagging it with the label “@next.” To add a label, simply type ”@” into the task field and start typing the task name.\n\nCreate a new @next label\n\nSee all your tasks labeled @next\nTasks with a due date and/or time\nFor items that must be completed at a specific date and/or time, schedule them. But be warned: GTD cautions against over-reliance on due dates. Only add them to the tasks that really have to be done on a given date and time. For everything else, trust your next actions and a regular weekly review of all your task lists (more on that later).\nWhile editing a task, you can click on the Schedule field and select a date and time from the calendar. Or simply type the due date and/or time into the task field using natural language, for example, next Monday at 8am. The smart Quick Add will automatically recognize and highlight the due date and add it when you save the task. You can even type in recurring due dates, like every other Wednesday, for tasks that repeat on a regular basis.\n\nType a due date into the task field using natural language like “Friday”\nYou can move items with due dates from the inbox to the relevant project or to the One-Off Tasks project if they aren’t associated with a multi-step project.\nTodoist Tip\nSync your Todoist with Google Calendar so that calendar events appear in Todoist as tasks and scheduled Todoist tasks appear in your Google Calendar as events.\n\nSee your Todoist tasks in your Google Calendar and your Google Calendar events in Todoist.\nAgendas\nSome of the items you capture in your inbox will be reminders of things you want to bring up with someone else rather than next actions. To keep track of these agenda items:\n\nCreate a new project called Agendas.\nCreate a new sub-project underneath Agendas for each person you need to touch base with on a regular basis. For example, your boss and any direct reports. You may also want to create sub-projects for each regular team or project meeting you have. For example, Marketing Weekly.\nAdd the items you need to bring up as tasks in the relevant agenda sub-project.\nWhen you meet with that person or come to the meeting, pull up the relevant project to see a list of all of the items you need to cover.\n(Optional) Share your agenda projects with the relevant people so everyone can see, add, and even assign items to discuss.\n\n\nCreate sub-projects underneath a master Agendas project for each regular meeting you have\nReference materials\nReference materials are non-actionable items that you need to save (e.g., tax documents, reading material, spreadsheets, Word docs, phone numbers, etc.). While they aren’t tasks themselves, they’re often needed to complete a task later. You can organize these kinds of supporting reference materials in Todoist by attaching them to the relevant task or project comments:\n\nTask-specific reference materials can be attached to the relevant task’s comments.\n\n\nAttach task-specific reference materials to task comments.\n\nHigher-level project materials (design specs, drafts, shared folders) can be attached or linked to in the project comments.\n\n\nSave project-level reference materials in project comments\nThis way, when you’re ready to start the task or project, you’ll have all of the information you need close at hand.\nYou’ll likely also have reference materials not associated with a specific task or project. For example, an article you saved from the web for later, a file with important information, or a gift idea for your partner’s next birthday. You can keep track of these in Todoist. Here’s how:\n\nCreate a new Reference project\nCreate new sub-projects underneath the Reference project for each type of reference list. For example, Gift Ideas, Birthdays, Contact Information, Recipes, etc.\nMove your reference material tasks to the appropriate project by dragging and dropping them from your Inbox. Or select a new project via Quick Add by clicking to edit the task and typing ”#” into the task field followed by the project name.\nTo collapse your reference sub-projects, click on the grey arrow to the left of your Reference parent project. This helps remove visual clutter from your list.\n\n\nCreate new projects for different types of reference materials\nWaiting for\nThese are items that have been delegated or are awaiting action by someone else. For example, if you need to finish writing a blog post but are waiting on your editor to get you feedback on your last draft. Identify these tasks by tagging them with the label “@waiting_for.” Keep @waiting_for tasks organized inside the projects they’re related to or inside the One-Off Tasks project if they’re unrelated to other tasks.\n\nLabel tasks your waiting on something to complete with an @waiting_for label\nSomeday/maybe\nMany items that you capture will be ideas for things you want to do in the future but don’t have the bandwidth to work on now (e.g., places you may want to travel, books to read, new projects you may want to try, ideas for blog posts, etc.). You want to be able to review these later, but you don’t want them gumming up your system now.\n\nCreate a new Someday/Maybe project\nAdd all of the tasks and/or you want to do in the future but aren’t actively working on\n(Optional) Add sub-projects for specific types of “Someday/Maybe” tasks. For example, you may want to separate Someday/Maybe — Personal and Someday/Maybe — Work projects\nReview your someday/maybe projects when time and energy open up to take on new work\n\n\nCreate a Someday/Maybe project to house your ideas for the future\nTasks that can be delegated\nIf you can delegate a task to free up your own time and energy, you should. In Todoist, you can share projects with people, assign them tasks with due dates, and collaborate in comments.\n\nShare projects and assign tasks to the people you collaborate with\nYour sharing setup will be different depending on your circumstances. Here are 3 ways you could set it up:\n\nCreate a separate shared project for each person you collaborate with (you could even reuse your Agendas sub-projects for this purpose)\nCreate a workspace dedicated to your team\nShare existing projects that involve heavy collaboration ad hoc\n\nOr you could use a combination of all three approaches.\nQuick Tip: You can search for all of the tasks you’ve delegated using the query “assigned by: me”. It’s a handy list to reference during your weekly review.\nContexts\nWith your project lists and tasks sorted, you’re now ready to tackle contexts. In GTD, contexts identify tools, places, or people that you require to complete a given task. In other words, contexts allow you to focus on what you can actually get completed, given your current circumstances. For example, if you are at your office, you don’t want to waste time sorting out all the next actions you have at home.\nFollowing the project approach, we laid out above, the easiest way to add contexts is with labels. GTD recommends the following contexts:\n\nComputer/internet\nHome\nOffice\nErrands\nCalls\nAnywhere\n\nYou can also add others that will help you sort your tasks quickly based on your current context. Some people like to add an Email context to take care of all their emails at once. Others add labels for the amount of time a task might take. For example, if you have just 15 minutes before your next meeting, it’s helpful to be able to identify all the tasks you could do quickly with an @15_min label. For most people, it’s more useful to create an “Offline” label rather than an “Internet” one for tasks you can do when you don’t have an Internet connection.\n\nCreate labels for each context\nIt’s tempting to go overboard and start creating labels for everything — resist the temptation. For your GTD system to work, you need to build a habit of adding the correct labels to each and every task. The fewer labels you have to choose from, the easier it will be to remember.\nFor a full guide on how to add and use labels in Todoist visit our Help Center.\nEngage\nHere is where the time spent clarifying and organizing your tasks pays off. Your system is now full of concrete, actionable items organized into logical categories, ready for you to jump in. You’ll see that all of the labels, projects, and due dates added in the steps above help you quickly answer the question “What should I be doing right now?” at any given moment.\nThe time spent clarifying and organizing your tasks means that when it’s time to engage with work, you have fewer choices to make and fewer reference materials to find. To decide what to do next, you can see upcoming tasks with due dates, sort tasks by label, or create filters to see your next actions based on context.\nToday and Upcoming views\nWhen you’re ready to sit down to work, click on Today in the left-hand navigation menu to see any tasks that you must complete today. Open Upcoming to see what’s coming down the pipeline this week and any week in the future.\n\nSee which tasks you need to get done today\n\nUse Upcoming view to visualize and plan the week ahead.\nView Next Actions and Contexts via labels\nTo view a full list of next actions across all your projects, type “@next” into the Quick Find bar at the top of your Todoist.\n\nSearch for a label to view all of the associated tasks\n\nSee all your next actions filtered by area of responsibility\nYou can also quickly sort your tasks by context by selecting a given label to see all the associated tasks. For example, if you search for @errands, you’ll see a list of tasks with the @errands label that can be completed while you’re already out and about. To see a list of all the tasks you’re waiting on something to complete, search for the label @waiting_for.\nYou can also view all the tasks tagged with a specific label by clicking on the label’s name in the label list to the left of your Todoist.\nCreate more custom task views with filters\nThe real GTD magic happens when you create your own custom task views in Todoist using filters. Filters are essentially saved searches that sort your list with one click. You can use filters to search for tasks based on:\n\nDue date\nLabel\nPriority\nProject\nDate a task was created\nAssignee\nKeywords\nOr a combination of some or all of the above\n\nWe have a full guide on how to set up and work with filters in our Help Center.\n\nSet up custom filters to view your next actions by Area of Focus\n\nSee all your next actions filtered by area of responsibility\nFor GTD, the most relevant labels will likely combine “@next_action” with an area of focus or a context. For example, to set up a filter for all the next actions you can do at work, use the query “##Work &amp; @next_action.” This will show all tasks in your Work project and associated sub-projects with the @next_action label. Or create a filter for next actions that can be finished at the office using the query “@next_action &amp; @office.”\nThe most useful task views will depend on your specific needs, but these are some of the most common useful ones:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFilter QueryShows you a list of:@next_actions &amp; todayAll next actions and all tasks due today across all of your projects@next_actions &amp;#WorkAll next actions in your Work project and all of your work sub-projects@next_actions &amp; @HomeAll your next actions you can do at home across all of your projects@waiting_forAll tasks you’re waiting on something to complete across all your projects@emailAll tasks that involve emailing someone so you can complete them all at once and minimize the time you spend in your email\nAdd your most important task views to your favorites so they appear at the top of your navigation menu above your Projects list. Simply right-click the filter, label, or project and select “Add to Favorites.” The filter will then show up in your navigation panel.\nReview\nEach week, set aside time to review your lists, organize your tasks, and keep your system running smoothly. The review helps you adapt to changes, refocus your attention, identify next actions, and reflect on your workflow.\nDavid Allen has called this weekly review a “critical factor for success” because frequent review of your system will ensure that you aren’t just doing things, but that you are doing the right things.\nTo get started, import Todoist’s GTD Weekly Review template into your projects list. This template includes all of the steps you’ll need to complete your review each week. Customize the template by adding sub-tasks or task comments to hold the lists of all your inboxes and your current areas of focus or to track reflections on your week.\n\nImport the GTD Weekly Review template into your Todoist\nSchedule your weekly review by setting up a recurring date in any task field. Simply enter your date in natural language, like “every Sunday at 5pm,” and Todoist will automatically recognize and schedule it when you save the task.\nWhat to read next\nThe weekly review is a powerful productivity ritual regardless of whether you GTD or not, so we wrote a standalone guide for how to run your weekly review.\n\nThere’s a reason why millions of people around the world swear that Getting Things Done changed their lives. While strict GTD isn’t for everyone, you’re bound to pick up a habit or two that will help you worry less and do more. Everyone interested in being less stressed and more productive should try it at least once.\nGive it a shot and see which aspects of GTD work for you!\nLaura Scroggs\nLaura is a freelance writer, PhD candidate, and pug mom living in Minneapolis, MN."},"Omnivore/PARA-기법--삶을-'제대로'-체계화하는-법":{"title":"PARA 기법- 삶을 '제대로' 체계화하는 법","links":["tags/Omnivore"],"tags":["Omnivore"],"content":"PARA 기법: 삶을 ‘제대로’ 체계화하는 법\n#Omnivore\nRead on Omnivore\nRead Original\nWebpage\nPARA 기법: 삶을 ‘제대로’\n체계화하는 법\n일잘러가 되기 위해 꼭 알아야하는 체계화 기법\nby\n우리는 주제별 분류에 익숙하다. 중·고교 시절에는 ‘수학’, ‘영어’, ‘과학’ ,‘한국사’, 대학교에 와서도 ‘심리학’ , ‘회계학’,‘경제학’,‘국문학’… 그래서 우리는 ‘주제’만 맞다면 모든 데이터를 하나의 카테고리에 분류하게 된다. 문제는, 학생 때와는 달리 사회에서는 수업도, 시험도, 성적도 없다. 다만 ‘달성하고자 하는 결과’만이 존재할 뿐이다. 새로운 제품을 출시하거나, 제품의 기획서를 작성하거나, 가족 휴가를 계획하거나, 이사를 결정하거나, 중요한 투자 결정을 내리거나, 브런치 글을 작성하거나 등.. 바쁜 일상 속에서 우리는 이러한 것들을 이루고자 노력하는 데에 있어서 ‘심리학’과 같은 방대한 카테고리를 샅샅이 뒤질 시간이 없다.\n그래서 PARA 기법에서는 학창시절부터 우리에게 너무나 익숙한 주제별 분류가 아닌, 지금 당장 전념하고 있는 프로젝트와 목표에 맞게 정리할 것을 권한다. PARA 이론의 창립자 Tiago Forte는 이를 **“organize by actionability”**라고 부른다. 우리 말로 해석하면, ‘실행 가능성별로 정리’정도가 되겠다. 예를 들어 ‘그래픽 디자인 프로젝트’를 진행하려면 해당 프로젝트와 관련된 모든 노트, 문서, 리소스, 기타 자료를 한 곳에 모아두고 즉각 즉각 사용할 수 있어야 한다고 Forte는 말한다.\n하나의 프로젝트를 실행하기 위해 우리는 다양한 주제를 넘나들며 가용 가능한 최대한의 리소스를 활용해야 한다. 그래픽 디자인 프로젝트를 진행하기 위해 필요한 정보는 비단 ‘그래픽 디자인’에만 한하지 않는다. 다양한 분야의 자료와 리소스가 필요할 것이다. 하지만 주제별 분류 방식 하에서는 각 주제별로 곳곳에 정보가 흩어져 있기 때문에, 관련 자료를 찾는 데만 많은 시간을 할애하게 된다.\n그렇다면**,** 각 프로젝트나 목표와 관련된 모든 자료를 어떻게 한곳에 모을 수 있을까? 정답은, 애초에 그렇게 정리하는 것이다. 이게 PARA의 골자다.\nPARA Method, 그래서 어떻게 하는건데?\nPARA는 Project, Area, Resource, Archive의 각 앞자를 따서 만든 것이다. 즉, 이 네 가지 개념만 숙지하고 이에 맞게 일상을 분류하면 그것만으로 이미 PARA 기법을 활용한다고 볼 수 있다.\n(출처: forte labs)\n\nProject\n목표와 데드라인이 명확한, 주로 단기적인 과업\n\n(예시)\n- 웹페이지 디자인 완성하기\n- 새 컴퓨터 구매하기\n- 보고서 작성하기\n- 브런치 글 작성하기\n- 일본어 회화 강의 Chapter 5 달성하기\n- 이사 계획 수립하기\n등등의 예시가 있을 수 있다. 이들의 특징은 ‘목표’나 ‘기간’이 명확하게 정해져있다는 것이다.\n\nArea (of responsibility)\n인생을 살면서 지속적으로 신경을 써야하는 것들\n\n(예시)\n- 직장\n- 건강\n- 투자\n- 자녀\nArea는 Area of responsibility를 말하고, 이는 직역하면 책임의 영역이다. 즉 평생 책임을 지고, 주의를 기울이며 지켜야하는 것들을 포함한다. 책임은 마케팅, HR 등 자신이 맡은 직무에 대한 일적 책임과 가족, 건강, 자동차, 부동산 등 개인적 책임으로 나눠볼 수 있다.\n\nResource\n자료나 관심 있는 것들을 주제별로 모아둔 것\n\n- 생산성\n- 커피\n- 음악\n- 일본어\n- 영어\n- 서비스 기획\n- SQL\n- AI\n- 웹디자인\n\nArchive\n현 시점에 필요없어진 것들을 모아두는 장소\n\n- 완료했거나, 보류 중인 Project\n- 필요 없어진 Area\n- 더 이상 관심이 없는 Resource\n아카이브에는 보통 지금 당장은 필요가 없지만, 언젠가 나중에 참조할 수 있도록 저장하고 싶은 이전의 세 가지 카테고리 (Project, Area, Resources)의 모든 항목을 포함한다.\n여기서 중요한 것은, PARA에서는 노트의 ‘정해진 위치’같은 게 존재하지 않는다는 점이다. 즉, Archive에 있는 것들이 필요에 의해서 Project나 Resource로 옮겨질 수 있다. 예를 들어 새로운 프로젝트를 시작하면서 아카이브에 있던 자료가 리소스로 올라올 수도 있다. PARA에는 이런 유연성이 존재한다. 지금 당장 내가 전념하고 있는 것, 방향성, 목표에 따라 지속적으로 변할 수 있다. 현 시점의 목표에 따라 내가 가진 모든 리소스를 유동적으로 변경하는 것이 아까 말한 ‘실행가능성에 따른 분류’인 것이다.\nPARA의 장점\nPARA를 쓰면 좋은 점에 대해서 간단하게 알아보자.\n- 지금 당장 중요한 일과 아닌 일의 구분이 명확해짐\n- 평생 해야하는 일과 당장 해야하는 일의 구분이 명확해짐\n- 필요한 정보를 제때 빠르게 찾을 수 있음\n- 유동적으로 노트의 위치를 바꿀 수 있어 노트 관리에 대한 부담이 덜함\n- PARA가 내 삶의 대시보드 역할을 해줌\nPARA를 활용한다는 것은\n(출처: 본인 Notion)\nPARA를 활용한다는 것은 업무와 삶의 구조를 파악하는 것, 즉 자신이 현재 어떤 일에 전념하고 싶은지, 무엇을 바꾸고 싶은지, 어디로 가고 싶은지를 파악하는 것이다. 즉 자신이 원하는 미래의 삶을 뒷받침하고 실현할 수 있는 방식으로 정보를 정리하는 것을 말한다.\n우리가 평소에 ‘정리’라고 부르는 것의 대부분이 사실은 ‘미루기(Procrastination)‘의 일종일지도 모른다. 스스로에게 ‘준비 중’이거나 ‘조사 중’이라고 말하며 마치 진전이 있는 것처럼 스스로를 안심시키지만, 실제로는 직면한 일을 해결해야한다는 불편한 현실을 외면하기 위해 조금이라도 더 다듬거나 정리할 수 있는 것을 찾고 있는 것은 아닐까? 마치 힘든 공부를 앞두고 책상이나 한번 더 깨끗하게 정리하는 것처럼 말이다.\nPARA는 이 점을 꿰뚫어보고, 다음 단계로 넘어가기 위해 필수적인 것을 제외하고는 어떠한 변명의 여지와 할 일도 남기지 않는 극단적으로 단순한 체계화 방법을 제시한다. 즉, 앞으로 나아가기 위해 필요한 정말 최소한의 질서만을 부여하는 것이다. 그 이상, 그 이하도 아니다. 마치 우리가 주방에서 식기, 그릇을 필요할 때 꺼내쓰듯이 언제든 필요할 때 우리가 정리해 둔 것을 꺼내 쓸 수 있듯이, ‘주제별’이 아닌, ‘필요별’로 일상을 체계화 하는 것이라는 점에서, PARA는 가장 실용적인 체계화 방법 중 하나이다.\n출처\nhttps://fortelabs.com/blog/para/\nhttps://www.taskade.com/blog/the-para-method/\n  "},"Omnivore/Why-Using-Obsidian-for-Life-Management":{"title":"Why Using Obsidian for Life Management","links":["tags/Omnivore"],"tags":["Omnivore"],"content":"Why Using Obsidian for Life Management\n#Omnivore\nRead on Omnivore\nRead Original\nWebpage\nThis post is an extension of my main post showcase of my Obsidian workflow. You might want to check it out as well.\nWhat is GTD ?\nIf you already know all of that, skip this section.\nGetting Things Done is a book written by David Allen. I recommend reading it, really. Like everything, reading key concepts online is good, but a whole book gives you a much better understanding of the underlying concepts described, why and how it works. I know it might sound like a lot of time, but it’s all worth it, trust me.\nBut if you still don’t have the time or the willingness to read GTD, try at least to read Todoist’s guide or my personal interpretation below.\nDefinitions\nA task is a clear action step, something to be done. It must be precise and concrete.\nA one-off task is a task that is enough by itself. Like “Calling the dentist to make an appointment” or “Doing the dishes”.\nA project is a bunch of tasks to achieve a goal. It must have a due date, at least one that you tell yourself.\nKey Concepts\nGTD is all about capturing every thoughts you have, clarifying them, organizing them, and acting on them. Your brain should be a factory for new ideas, not a warehouse.\nSo you need an inbox, easily and quickly accessible everywhere to clear your head. We’ll use Todoist and the obsidian-todoist-plugin for that, but more on that latter. Every-time something (small or big) crosses your mind, you capture (step 1) it in here. It might be “clean the house” or “learn to play piano”, anything really.\nThen you need to clarify (step 2) these items you’ve captured. For instance :\n\nA task must be a clear and concrete action step (“laundry” ❌ → “Do the laundry at the laundrette” ✅).\nA project must be a goal to achieve (use the SMART goal setting).\nA reference material might be a note, a link, or a document to store that might help achieving some tasks. Or you might just need to store it for later unknown purpose. Be careful not to fall in the collector fallacy trying to store and remember everything as if Wikipedia didn’t yet exist.\n\nYou then organise (step 3) them :\n\nA task might be delegated or waiting for something, it might be the next action of a project, it might have to wait for a start date, be scheduled for a particular day, have a due date, etc.\nA project must have a due date, we need time constraint because it helps us see how much we have to do and not put too much on our plate. If there’s no due date, it goes into the someday maybe list of things you’d do one day.\nA reference material must be filled accordingly. If it’s a piece of information you can create a note, if it’s a document you might use your cloud storage, if it’s a link you might save it using Omnivore.\n\nTasks in obsidian-tasks vault have different properties, and are displayed by urgency using the default sorting. In short, you have to worry about these one using my template :\n\nHappens date :\n\nA due date : Date by which the task needs to be completed.\nA scheduled date : Date on which you plan to work on your task\nA start date : Date by which you can start working on a specific task. Possibly because you can’t do that task before this date.\n\n\nContext tag : A tag describing in which context you can do this task. This can be something like “phone”, “online”, “errands”, “mail”, “transports”, etc.\nTime available : Not used actively in this vault but might take the form of a tags as well.\nEnergy available : Used in this vault but in the form of a tags just like contexts.\nPriority : Task property from obsidian-task plugin.\n\nYou must review (step 4) your system periodically. That’s why I’m using daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly and yearly notes. But more on that later as well, just remember that this is a really important part of the process and helps maintaining it.\nFinally, you need to engage (step 5) → It’s about time to get things done don’t you think ? That’s the fifth part.\nHorizons of Focus\nIn GTD, there’s multiple horizons of focus :\n\nTasks : Actions to take\nProjects : A bigger task with two or more sub-tasks\nAreas of focus/responsibility : Areas of your life with a standard to maintain\nGoals &amp; Objectives : Short term goals for this or next year (1-2 years)\nVisions : How and where do you see yourself in a few years (3-5 years)\nPurpose and principles : Who you are, what is your purpose and on what principles do you live\n\nI learned that having goals alongside projects didn’t work for me as I would put goals somewhere but never act on it. That’s why on this system inside obsidian, projects are goals, they live inside areas of my life.\nIf I have a goal to become an artist, I might have a daily recurring task inside that would be “Draw for 15min each day”. Or if I want to have a nice party next weekend as a goal, I might need to contact friends, prepare my shopping list, take friday off, etc.\nYou can’t just put on simple goals on a list and hope that your actions will go toward them. It won’t. But if you create a goal inside one of your areas file, that links to a project note where you can put next actions and notes, you’ll move forward and clear that goal before the estimated due date !\nSo in our case with this Obsidian setup :\n\nTasks : They can be created simply by using markdown tasks formatting anywhere on your vault except the _Sources folder, the -Workout-Log folder, the 4-Archives folder, the 5-Templates folder and the Media Backlog note. The obsidian-tasks is configured to exclude these folders by design choice.\nProjects : They live inside the 1-Projects folder. One note by goals or objectives, and inside the note you can put the tasks alongside notes and embedded attachments, just like you would with a piece of paper.\nAreas : Areas contains projects. That’s where you’re creating your projects in the form of obsidian tasks. You can use wikilinks to create the project note while doing so. You can also have some recurring tasks to maintain the area standard. And finally there’s an archive to clear the clutter using obsidian-tasks-archiver plugin.\nVisions, purpose and principles : They are less actionable and don’t require constant consideration. Just update the note every once in a while when you feel like your long term goals have changed after a big event in your life. Don’t change them often, focus on achieving tasks to progress in your goals instead.\n\nHow to Use This Vault Template for Life Management\nInbox\nAlright, so if we want to have a GTD setup, first we need an Inbox. And those of you who already had an obsidian vault with some plugins might have spotted an important issue : Obsidian is slow to launch.\nWell, fortunately there’s a Todoist plugin for obsidian that gather tasks from your Todoist account. You can now quickly jot notes and tasks on your phone and computer directly inside Todoist’s inbox using shortcuts and see them inside the 0-Inbox file inside the 0-Inbox folder, or inside your daily-notes !\n\nWhy Using a Daily and Periodic Notes Instead of a Beautiful and Perfect Dashboard ?\nI used Notion, Notion users love clean dashboard. Obsidian folks love them too. Why I hate them ? I’m a perfectionist with many OCD1 issues. If I’m using a Dashboard, I’ll need to update it every time I feel like it (often), and end up spending more time fine tuning a board and maintaining it than acting on my life.\nUsing Daily and Periodic Notes allows you to use template, modify these templates if needed but without needing backward modifications everywhere.\n\nEmbrace the fact that you can change along your life journey.\n\nIt also provides an easy way to zoom in or zoom out to get the big picture. For instance, during a stressed period one might only rely on the daily notes and the current most important project. And as things calm down, you might consider seeing weekly, then monthly, eventually quarterly and finally yearly notes for projects plans and move their due date before to work on them.\nI spoke about reviewing your system periodically before. I used to have some “periodic” checklist to do every periods. I ended that as it became a habit to sort pictures daily, budget weekly, clean files monthly, backup quarterly and yearly. But you might also use these notes template with tasks to do at the beginning or end of each period. Even if you don’t, having periodic notes “forces” you to review where you are by zooming in and out of your day to day activities.\nYou also get a cool archive of tasks and projects achieved, and that’s great !\nThe Daily Note\nThe daily note is the note you’ll open each morning when you wake up and each evening when you finish your working day.\nThe first part looks like this :\n\nThe name of the note is the current date in the ISO 8601 format. You also get the weekday, and some navigation to the periodic notes where the day belongs to and to the previous and next day.\nYou also have some shortcut to you Dashboard 🗺️ and Taskboard ✅ files, they helps you not to miss a project or a task respectively inside your vault. More on that later.\nThen there’s some introductions callouts :\n\nOngoing medias from your Media Backlog → Dataview script that show the medias inside columns containing the word Doing.\nTime left in each periods → Using a dataviewjs function based on the one provided to me by Dovos from the Dataview discord following an obsidian post.\nGoogle calendar weekly view → Using obsidian-google-calendar plugin to show a weekly view of your google calendar.\nTasks Calendar using obsidian-tasks-calendar plugin based on obsidian-tasks and obsidian-dataview plugins.\nOngoing and upcoming projects from your areas files inside 2-Areas folder.\n\nThere’s also a notes space where you can create some one-off tasks while clarifying the Todoist inbox that sits just below.\nThe second part is all about tasks :\n\nIt’s just a simple set of callout containing tasks queries :\n\nOverdue tasks\nTasks due today\nUpcoming tasks in the next 30 days\nNext actions grouped by context tags\nWaiting for tasks\nDelegated tasks\n\nYou finally get to the journaling part :\n\nThis part contains :\n\nA task log for tasks done today\nYour workout log scanning for daily workouts\nYour recurring tasks\n\nAnd finally : Your journal ! Evaluate your mood (1-5), give a title to your day, write down your thoughts, be grateful, and write down the good things you brought to this world.\nThe Periodic Notes\nBasically a periodic note look like this :\n\nYou will get for each periodic view some slightly different templates :\n\nThe time left callout\nA google calendar weekly view if on a weekly note, or schedule view if on a monthly note\nA task calendar with a weekly or monthly view depending on the note type\nYour projects happening during this time period\nThe projects you achieved during this time period\nA task log (only if on a weekly note)\nA journal entry\n\nHow Not to Miss a Task or Project Inside My Vault ?\nThe TaskBoard ✅ and Dashboard 🗺️ files will find any unplanned task or project inside your vault, as long as they are not inside any of the excluded files and folders :\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n1 2 3 4 5path does not include Archives path does not include Templates path does not include Workout_Log path does not include Media Backlog path does not include _Sources\nThe Someday Maybe Note\nThe Someday Maybe 💭 file is where you put your future goals and objectives in the form of a simple bullet list. Nothing fancy, we don’t care it’s not important as of now. But you might want to put things you want to do here, wait for a bit and decide if they’re still relevant after a while.
